# testvagrant
#RCB test
Take the latest 
Open the project in Eclipse
Open the testng.xml file
Run the testng.xml
after the execution is over, open the report from ./test-output/emailable-report.html

Note: 
1. As this is a sample project, i have not integrated with extend report and using the testng default report.
2. I can also set the file path in a property file but for now i have saved in a variable in this project. but all such data shall be in config file.
